REM The following is a modified version of Mr Gray's password recovery script for the USB rubber ducky. Modifications include googleKnowsBest's ducky drive detection if the drive is labeled "DUCKY", which has been coded to work on all current windows OS's, and a modification to run from a folder on the ducky labeled "MrGraysRubberHacks". This payload has also been tweaked to be a little more forgiving to errors, and as such has some more delays. Forgiving as this script is, it may need customized delays depending on the users requirements. The payload is designed for c_duck_v2_S001.hex, and c_duck_v2_S002.hex firmware types. Wait for the ducky's drive to mount, and then press the button to launch this payload. This payload may also be launched using a tandem duck attack in which you use stock duck firmware, linked to a mass storage device via a 2 port USB cable splitter. This method would mount the mass storage almost instantaneously which would negate the need to wait for the ducky's mass storage to mount. The forum page is located here:
